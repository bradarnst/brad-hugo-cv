Hi. I hope you don't mind my contact out of the blue.
I may be able to help out with a role on a project you are on. Well, according to a Wipro Digital spreadsheet that was shared with me that indicates you are managing a project with a role that may be a good fit for me. I am currently working for Wipro Digital. But, for the Buildit team (if you've heard of us). Some of us are underutilised and we are looking for other roles within Wipro Digital.

I think that Job Code 1253674 could be a good fit.
